# Pokémon Emerald EX Dex

A searchable reference for Pokémon Emerald EX 1.0.4 species and forms, stats, types,
learnsets, evolutions, and TM/HM compatibility.

The client fetches data from the SQL-backed `/api/v1` API.
It includes all 1,523 species/form entries, search by name or exact internal species ID
(including `#0001`), type filtering, sorting by ID/name/base stat total/speed, and paginated
results with linked species detail pages. Duplicate names remain separate entries keyed by ROM
species/form ID. Stats are base stats, not calculated battle stats.

Click a species name to see all its imported data: base stats and types, level-up moves,
incoming and outgoing evolution rules, internal form changes, and compatible TMs/HMs.
Expand move names for descriptions and full move data, or evolution rules for their
conditions and ROM identifiers. Related species link to their own pages. Detail URLs
such as `#/species/1` can be bookmarked; returning to the list preserves its filters
during the session. JSON exports in `docs/` are import inputs and test fixtures;
neither the client nor the server reads them at runtime.

## SQL database preparation

MySQL/MariaDB schema for an existing shared database, a prepared transactional import
of all four JSON exports, verification queries, and API query examples are in
`scripts/sql/`. See [database setup and import instructions](docs/database.md).
All dex tables, explicitly named constraints and indexes use the `emerald_ex_` prefix.

Regenerate the import after changing the source exports:

```bash
npm run db:generate-import
```

The API reads these prefixed tables in the database selected by its configuration.
See [API endpoints and deployment](docs/api.md).

## Tech stack

* Node.js
* TypeScript
* npm
* React + Tailwind CSS + Vite

## Requirements

* Node.js version from `.nvmrc`
* npm version from `package.json`

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Import the schema and data into local MariaDB using the [database instructions](docs/database.md).
Create `.env.local` in the repository root with your local configuration:

```dotenv
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=emerald_ex_dev
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=your_local_password
DEX_DATASET_ID=emerald-ex-1.0.4
```

Keep credentials in this ignored file. `.env.local` takes precedence over `.env` during
development; process environment variables take precedence over both. Production
(`NODE_ENV=production`) ignores `.env.local`.

Build the shared package and start the backend in one terminal:

```bash
npm run build -w packages/shared
npm run dev:server
```

Start the client in a second terminal:

```bash
npm run dev:client
```

Open the Vite URL printed in the terminal. Vite forwards `/api` requests to
`http://127.0.0.1:3000`; set `DEV_API_TARGET` in `.env.local` if the backend uses a
different address. The backend checks the configured dataset at startup and closes
its database pool on shutdown.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

Run the read-only integration tests against your imported local database:

```bash
npm run test:db
```

These require local database credentials and the original 1.0.4 import. They refuse
a remote `DB_HOST`. Regular `npm run check` does not require a running database.

## Full check

```bash
npm run check
```

## Environment variables

For a new local setup, copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your local
database credentials. Keep production configuration in `.env` or process environment
variables. See [configuration and deployment](docs/api.md).

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```
